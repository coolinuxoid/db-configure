# db-configure
1. Main script file is db-configure.sh
2. This script will ask you for selection of databases type among MySQL and PostgreSQL server to configure
3. Then it will check if this database server is running, if not it will try to start it. 
4. If selected database is not installed, it will ask you to install it or not.
5. After installation script will give you option configure to set root password of database server
6. Finally script will ask to add new database, user and user's password. 
That's it
Have fun :)
